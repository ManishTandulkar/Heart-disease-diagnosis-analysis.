Title : Heart disease diagnosis analysis.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

Heart Disease Diagnosis:
Disease: 51.32% of the patients are diagnosed with heart disease.
No Disease: 48.68%.

Chest Pain Type Distribution:
ATA (Atypical Angina): 48.49% (Female: 35.51%, Male: 12.98%).
ASY (Asymptomatic): 27.71% (Female: 17.07%, Male: 10.63%).
NAP (Non-Anginal Pain): 16.29% (Female: 10.73%, Male: 5.56%).
TA (Typical Angina): 7.51% (Female: 6.24%, Male: 1.27%).

Exercise-Induced Angina:
Female: 69.56% (Yes: 26.44%, No: 43.12%).
Male: 30.44% (Yes: 7.22%, No: 23.22%).

Thallium Stress Test (Blood Flow Analysis):
Normal Blood Flow: 51.01% (Female: 27.1%, Male: 24.91%).
Reversible Defect: 40.89% (Female: 35.27%, Male: 5.62%).
Fixed Defect: 6.44% (Female: 6.2%, Male: 0.42%).

Age and Gender Impact:
The age range of 44 to 61 shows the highest likelihood of heart disease.
Female patients are more likely to be diagnosed with heart disease.

Critical Risk Factors for Heart Disease:
Exercise-Induced Angina: Negative in 69.61% of patients, 3 times more likely to cause the disease.
Chest Pain Type (1): Present in 89% of patients with heart disease, 2.32 times more likely to cause the disease.
Number of Major Blood Vessels (Type 0): Present in 74.29% of patients, 2.13 times more likely to cause the disease.
Slope of Peak Exercise ST Segment (Type 2): Present in 75.35% of patients, 2.09 times more likely to cause the disease.

Insights:

Gender Disparities:
Women show higher rates of fasting blood sugar and exercise-induced angina compared to men.
Women's likelihood of reversible blood flow defects is significantly higher.

Chest Pain and Disease Correlation:
The most common chest pain type for patients with heart disease is ASY (21.37%).

Impact of Blood Flow Defects:
Reversible Defects contribute significantly to heart disease risk, especially in females.

Preventative Recommendations:
Early interventions targeting individuals aged 44–61, especially women, can significantly reduce risks.
Attention to chest pain type and exercise-induced angina is critical in diagnostics.

Short Summary:
The dashboard highlights the high prevalence (51.32%) of heart disease, with key risk factors such as exercise-induced angina, chest pain type, and specific blood flow defects. Women, particularly those aged 44–61, are more vulnerable. The analysis emphasizes the importance of using data-driven tools for accurate and early diagnosis to mitigate risks and improve treatment outcomes.
